Offensive Security Consultant and Pentester.

I spend my time breaking into things so companies can fix them before someone with worse intentions does. Over the past couple of years I’ve worked on web apps, networks, APIs, and big corporate environments, always looking for the weak spots that could turn into real problems.

Outside of client work, I dig into security research, explore new attack techniques, and share what I learn with the community. I like turning complex offensive security concepts into something practical and useful, whether that’s through research, writeups, or just helping others get started in the field.

In short, I like finding holes, figuring out why they matter, and helping people close them.
