# Welcome to my blog!  
I’m **hexkaster**, an Offensive Security Consultant and Pentester who spends most of his time breaking into systems so companies can fix them before someone with worse intentions does.  

## What I Do  
Over the past few years I’ve worked on **web applications, APIs, networks, and large corporate environments**, always looking for the cracks that could turn into real issues. My day-to-day covers **red team operations, pentesting, and threat intelligence across Latin America**.  

Outside of client work, I dive into **security research and new attack techniques**. I enjoy putting ideas into practice, writing about them, and turning advanced offensive security concepts into something others can actually use. I’ve also organized **CTFs and trainings**, since teaching is one of the best ways to sharpen skills.
